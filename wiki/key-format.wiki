<h1>Key Format</h1>

<div>The public key is the primary key (the ID) of a key. &nbsp;Other fields
are:</div>

<div>
<ul>
<li>Private key (for secret key ring) - the private key may be protected by a
pass phrase and a pass file</li>
<li>Nickname (for humans)</li>
<li>Full name (for humans)</li>
<li>Creation and expiration dates</li>
</ul>

<h2>Signatures</h2>

<div>Keys may be signed, we treat key signatures as separate entities. &nbsp;A
signature consists of</div>

<div>
<ul>
<li>The pubkey of the signed key</li>
<li>The pubkey of the signer</li>
<li>The "digest", the cryptographic checksum that proves that the signer has
signed the key</li>
</ul></div>

<div>This feature will be implemented when Dan Bernstein integrates signatures
into NaCl; maybe a bit earlier, since the code for these signatures is already
tested.</div></div>
