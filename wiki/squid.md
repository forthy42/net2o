# The $quid – CryptoCurrency and BlockChain

![Squid](https://fossil.net2o.de/net2o/doc/trunk/doc/net2o-squid-200.png)

## Abstract

10 years after BitCoins original document, the BlockChain and crypto
currencies are a big hype. Time to look at the results of the
experiment, see what failed and what works, check the consequences for
society, and propose improvements.

## Introduction

I figured out that the user layer of my net2o peer to peer protocol
needs some sort of contract/currency transaction protocol, and when
secure protocols meet money, it's not just technology that
matters. This paper therefore will therefore take both sides into
consideration.

## Purpose of a currency (with history lesson)

### Trade vs. speculation object

Where does the need for money come from?

### Early forms of money

Stone age society started with share economy: When you had something
in abundance, you'd share it with your larger family, the small tribe
you were associated with.  You'd expect the other members to share
their pray or whatever they had to share with you, too.  You can do
that, because there's trust and established relationship.

When society grew larger, this no longer worked.  You would trade
things, e.g. meat vs. plants or tools.  The obvious problem with that
is: you need to find someone who has a need for your thing and at the
same time provides something you have a need for.

That could be solved by exchanging tokens that everybody considered
valuable, that were easy to carry, but rare enough nobody could get
them too easily: That is the birth of money.  The first known money
mankind used was “shell money” (in Chinese: 貝/贝 still means
“money”), shells of maritime snails.  They were picked up at the
shore, so you had to invest a certain amount of work to get them.

Shell money was the more valuable the further away from the shore, so
when metallurgy was invented, the people from the mountain came up
with shiny metal coins as hard to get but easy to carry and
longlasting valuables, creating silver and gold standards for
currencies.  Both shells and noble metals can serve as jewellery, so
it's not completely useless, but the main purpose for money is a proxy
for exchanged values, so you can exchange the things you have and the
things you need with different persons.  The money itself decouples
the individual acts of trade.

### Paper money

These scarce tokens were chosen to ensure that you need a certain
amount of work to gather them, so when your time has a value, you
wouldn't waste too much on collecting shells or mining gold.  The
problem is: these things have a limited availability, and when society
and economy grows, you run out of tokens.  This leads to deflation,
and in deflation, people tend to hord their money (spending it
tomorrow gets you more than spending today), which is instable, and
deflation gets worse.  If it was just lack of work to get the tokens,
society would ramp up collecting shells and mining noble metals, but
if there is a natural limit to get more shells or gold, you need
another idea.

The first early forms of paper money were financial products, the
promissory note.  Instead of actually paying, you just gave the
promise.  That allows to inflate the amount of available money to keep
business going.  That however comes with a problem of trust: You have
to trust that promise.

Eventually, in the 12th century, the first state took over the role of
the trustee, and China's Song dynasty created the first legal tender
as a paper note, the 会子 (huizi, literally: a child will come), which
still is a promissory note, but now issued by a much larger and more
powerful entity, which is easier to trust than a bank.

Of course, the issue that came up quickly was forgery, because the
whole point of paper money is to make it quick and easy to produce,
and regulate the amount of money in circulation by authoritive
decisions, not by how much work was available for doing that job.  The
money got stamped with seals which were difficult to make, but could
be used for many notes, and can be kept under control.  That is a
proof of ownership and authority: You can issue a note if you proof
that you own the seal.

## Money and wealth

How money shapes a society, and why the limited supply of BitCoins is
far worse than neoliberalism

## How to really distribute book-keeping
