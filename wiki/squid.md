# The $quid – CryptoCurrency and BlockChain

![Squid](../doc/squid-logo.png)

## Abstract

*10 years after BitCoins “whitepaper”, the BlockChain and crypto
currencies are a big hype. Time to look at the results of the
experiment, see what failed and what works, check the consequences for
society, and propose improvements.*

*BitCoin's technology has three problems which need to be fixed:*

  + *The unfair distribution of coins*
  + *The energy consumption of proof of work*
  + *The non-scaleable replicated, but not partitioned ledger*

The lightning network tries to address the last point, by doing transactions
off-chain.

_Note: I want to point out that a service-oriented business model for free
software works, but inevitably pushes the companies into a business model,
where only the complaint department makes money.  If you don't want to stick
your head into a pig due to the depressive AI of the useless Sirius
Cypernetics Corporation products you got, make sure that there is a business
model for creating good, easy to use, and cheap to maintain software._

Incentives matter.  Economy is all about game theory.
