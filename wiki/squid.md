# The $quid â€“ CryptoCurrency and BlockChain

## Abstract

10 years after BitCoins original document, the BlockChain and crypto
currencies are a big hype. Time to look at the results of the
experiment, see what failed and what works, check the consequences for
society, and propose improvements.

## Introduction

I figured out that the user layer of my net2o peer to peer protocol
needs some sort of contract/currency transaction protocol, and when
secure protocols meet money, it's not just technology that
matters. This talk therefore will therefore take both sides into
consideration.

## Purpose of a currency (with history lesson)

Trade vs. speculation object

## Proof of What?

How to cheaply secure the BlockChain

## Money and wealth

How money shapes a society, and why the limited supply of BitCoins is
far worse than neoliberalism

## How to really distribute book-keeping
