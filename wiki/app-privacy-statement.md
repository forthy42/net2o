# Android App Privacy Statement #

The Gforth and net2o Android app require the camera and audio
recording permission.  At the moment, the recording is only used in
''android-recorder.fs'' and only stored locally.

Future additions planned will allow to send and receive camera and
audio recordings via net2o, i.e. end-to-end encrypted.
