# The Unseen University's Wizards Guidelines of Slightly Posh Behavior

![Wizards](wizards.jpg)

This project adopts the Unseen University's Wizards Guidelines of Slightly
Posh Behavior as revised by Mustrum Ridcully as <s>Code</s><u>Guideline</u> of
Conduct.

The current UUWGoSPB is a gamified hierarchic meritocratic system, which
considers evidence based science as foundation.  Wizardry is casting spells
that make the universe doing what you want it to do, and it can't deny that
order.  In Roundworld, the only wizardry that exists is computer programming:
you cast spells (write source code) that, when executed on an appropriate
machine, make that machine do what you told it to.

The harder part of all those spells is to make sure the wizard survives.  Only
well debugged spells give them a chance.

Wizards are depicted as old, bearded white men, but that's just a stereotype.

## <s>Rules</s><u>Guidelines</u>

1. Thou shallst not assassinate any superior to get into their place. This is
   not limited to physical harm, but also character assassination, doxxing,
   mobbing, etc.<br />
   _(Ridcully's Razor)_

2. Thy level in the wizardry bases on talent, education, proven wizardry
   performance, and availability of positions in the level you want to
   achieve. Raise in level is granted by your teachers. There are in total
   8^(8-n) positions in level n.<br />
   _(Previous Supreme Law Number 1, <s>cast in</s> <u>turned into</u> stone)_

3. It matters what thou doest for the magic, not what thou art, and it matters
   that this is fun.<br />
   _(Alberto Malich's Rule 1)_

## <s>Guidelines</s><u>Suggestions</u>

4. Thou art supposed to teach what thou knowest to those with the appropriate
   talent, and learn what thou doest not if thou hast the talent.

5. In case thy temper is going full bursar, eat dried frog pills and calm down.

6. Celibacy is mandatory¹.  Up to seven sons are tolerated, but keep track of
   all of them.  Daughters count as sons.  They all start at level 1, and need
   magical potty training.

7. Dress and grow thy white facial hair accordingly to look authentic.

8. Monitor thy caffeine level to avoid being too far into the sober side, eat
   enough pizza, go to bed late, and sleep long.  Unless thou art one of those
   early risers, then just stay quiet during thy morning exercise.

## <s>Suggestions</s><u>The End</u>

¹) Note: All available data from the seamstresses’ guild suggests that the
closest thing to actual celibacy is a stable relationship, i.e. a marriage.
